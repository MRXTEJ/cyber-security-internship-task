# Task 5: Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## Objective:
Capture and analyze network packets.

## Tools Used:
- Wireshark

## Steps Performed:
1. Installed Wireshark
2. Captured packets
3. Filtered and identified protocols

## Protocols Identified:
- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **HTTP**: Used for web communication.
- **TCP**: Reliable transport layer protocol.

## Sample Packet Analysis:
- DNS Query: A request to resolve `neverssl.com`.
- HTTP GET: Request to load `neverssl.com`.
- TCP SYN: Connection initiation packet.

## Outcome:
Learned how to use Wireshark for basic packet analysis.
