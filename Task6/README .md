## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use **12 or more characters**
- Include **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**
- Avoid using common words or sequences (like `password`, `123456`)
- **Don’t reuse** passwords across websites
- Use **passphrases** like `Time4@Cup_of_Tea!`
- Use a **password manager** to store complex passwords securely

---

## 🧠 Common Password Attacks

### 1. **Brute Force Attack**
Tries all possible combinations until it cracks the password. More characters = longer time to break.

### 2. **Dictionary Attack**
Uses a list of common words or leaked passwords. Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.

---

## 🛡 Why Password Length & Complexity Matter

- Longer passwords increase the number of possible combinations
- Complexity (symbols, uppercase, etc.) prevents simple cracking techniques
- Together they make brute-force and dictionary attacks ineffective

---

## 🔒 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
An additional layer of security. Even if someone knows your password, they need a second verification method (e.g., OTP, fingerprint, Authenticator app).

---

## 🧰 Password Managers
Tools that:
- Store complex passwords securely
- Auto-fill credentials
- Help generate strong passwords (e.g., LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password)

---

## 🔐 What Are Passphrases?
A series of random words or a meaningful sentence that’s easy to remember but hard to guess. Example: `Blue!Elephant_Jumps@Sunset1984`
